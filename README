This initiable set of functions works to:
1. Compile geolocations from dataset(s) taken from  a series of pictures in JPEG. 
2. Organize the geolocations according to desired use - creating textured 3D visualizations,
  locating specified/filtered area types (proximity to uni- or multi-points, etc?), updating simu-link databases, etc?
3. Query and Parse JPEG metadata in relation to geolocation
